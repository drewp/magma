all you can do is issue commands, where each 'issue' has a
time+user+command, and each command has any amount of RDF graph that
goes with it. But there are no other parameters in the commands,
"count down 5 min" and "count down 10 min" are two commands that have
to be separately constructed. 

The issued commands are logged, and then everything else happens based
on what we can infer from the log and the current time. Other systems 
can log as well.

Multiple english texts might map to the same command, sort of like
AIML expands each fact into multiple english forms that could be
asking for the fact. "alarm 10 min" and "count down 10 minutes" might
be the same command.

Example: countdown

3:29 db is empty
3:30 issue1 (3:30, drewp, "count down 5 min")
3:31 nothing happens, since it's not after 3:35
3:35 need an alarm to go to drewp, since issue1 asked for it
(based on idle times, also in the log, we decide to send a jabber message)
3:35 send jabber message, and log that we've successfully carried out the notification for issue1

Example: lights out, with a cancel

11:29 lights are on due to previous log events
11:30 issue1 (11:30, drewp, "lights out")
11:30 start a 3 minute fade of the lights
11:31 issue2 (11:31, kelsi, "cancel lights out")
11:31 we figure out where the lights were before 11:30 and start a 5 second fade to that level
11:40 drew asks why the lights are on: they're on because a lights out command was canceled, and before the lights out command the lights were on due to ...

Example: light level adjustment

3:01 light at 0%
3:02 issue1 (3:02, drew, "light")
3:02 light at 100%
3:03 why is the light at 100%? Because drew requested light at 3:02
3:05 issue2 (3:05, kelsi, "light down 20%")
3:05 light at 80%
3:06 why is the light at 80%? Because kelsi requested a 20% reduction from drew's requested light
3:10 issue3 (3:10, drew, "light to 50%")
3:10 light at 50%
3:11 why is the light at 50%? Because drew set it at 3:10
3:12 issue4 (3:12, drew, "undo")
3:12 light at 80%
3:13 why is the light at 80%? Because kelsi requested a 20% reduction from drew's requested light
3:15 how much power has the light used since 3:00? .06kWh, or .4% of today's expected power, or $0.007 of commercial electricity

Example: podcast

3:01 issue1 (3:01, kelsi, "play new")
3:01 start playing radio4.mp3
3:03 why is this playing? because kelsi asked for new radio and this is the oldest unheard podcast that kelsi would like
3:15 log that radio4.mp3 is done

Example: morning alarm

21:00 timed event: rescan my work calendar. the first meeting at 10:00 means drew needs to be at work by 10:00, which means leave home by 09:40, which means get up by 08:40.
23:30 alarm? it's set to 08:40 because of a meeting at 10:00

suggested commands list now contains an alarm cancel and a snooze.


Example: thermostat heater



Example: temporary watch on web logs

3:01 for the next week, tell me when new visitors come to bigasterisk.com/foo


Example: chasing me down for a notification

some notification systems have a timeout, like we can send a jabber
message to a presence=away person, but if the presence doesn't return
quickly enough, we may want to send SMS


Example: choosing music

2:30 logged: saw kelsi's phone
3:01 issue1 (3:01, drew, "play")
3:01 pick a song that drew and kelsi both like. announce "playing music for drew and kelsi"

Example: daily news

7:00 issue1 (7:00, kelsi, "news")
7:00 """
