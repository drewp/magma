magma web ui and others call CommandLog.addCommand(uri, time, user),
which records the new issue to sesame and sends pings to the hub, one
for every commandclass:

  (topic: 'newCommand')
  issue: uri
  commandClass: uri (you probably filter on this one)
  command: uri
  created: datetime
  creator: uri

listeners receive POST calls with a json object of those same
keys. Strictly, they only need the issue uri, and they get the rest
from the graph.



arduino REST api:
/pin/d0 PUT '0' or '1', or GET
/pin/d0/mode PUT 'output'


---------------------

how does the data come together for reasoning?

we update some statements about the latest versions of things, then
retrigger the rules and consider the output.

kelsi position is within 100m of house + nighttime [+ kelsi not at home] -> kelsi coming home -> front lights on

goodnight button pressed -> lights off
